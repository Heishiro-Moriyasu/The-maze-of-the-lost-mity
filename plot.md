## Chapter One: **across**
*Kai and Jemo, on the way back home*
(Kai) Well, school life sucks. But I am excited about the Thanksgiving Day.
(Jemo) What? You have no lessons at Thanksgiving?
(Kai) Yeah. But we still have to have Spanish lessons.
(Jemo) Hmm... You're lucky, we actually have no holidays. But I have no lessons tomorrow. We can go to the new restaurant near our school, isn't that great?
(Kai) Yay! Love you!

*At home*
(Kai) Hey, where's Mity?
(Jemo) Dunno. Mity? Mity! That's strange. Er, maybe she is still at school?
(Kai) No! She has no lessons today! She should at home now! My sister, she...
(Jemo) Hey - hey! It's okay, we can find her. Here, your kitty.
(Poñavi) M- Meow? (What?)
(Kai) Oh! Mi Poñavi! Come here and hug your papá- Mmm...
(Poñavi) Meow... (Well okay...)
(Jemo) Hey, let's take a walk with Poñavi okay?
(Kai) Good idea! Maybe we can find Mity out there!

*Out there...*
(Kai) Hey, look! I don't remember there is a path! Let's go!
(Poñavi) M- Meow... (I may not like this...)
(Kai) It's dark!
(Jemo) Let's go back?
(Kai) No, wait! Look! It is a maze!
(Jemo) Okay, don't... Wait, what?

### Book in the maze (Short Plot I) - When "Sophies_world.pdf" is in the The-maze-of-the-lost-mity\files
(Kai) What? Look! A lecture portfolio!
(Jemo) No! It is a book! "Sophies world"... Why there is no quotation mark between "Sophie" and "s"?
(Kai) Gimme that! "Sophie Amundsen was on her way home from school. She had walked the first part of the way with Joanna. They had been discussing robots. Joanna thought the human brain was like an advanced computer. Sophie was not certain she agreed. Surely a person was more than a piece of hardware?" Well, that is a good book.
*Get "Sophies world"*

### Weird Card (Short Plot II)
(Kai) Knock knock!
(Jemo) This time?
(Kai) Hey!
(Jemo) Hey who?
(Kai) No!
(Jemo) Hey no?
(Kai) No! Look! Here's a card!
(Jemo) What the-
(Kai) It says, "(Dr.) Pos Ibel, TEL:13..." It's blackened!
*Get the Card*

(Jemo) Y- Yeah, cousin, g- go!
(Poñavi) Go! After me! I know we should go left!

*After going left*

(Poñavi) Look! A stele! There are some strange scotch here!
(Kai) Hey! I am not strange!
(Poñavi) No! I said that is strange!
(Jemo) Interesting. We should write them down.
